<font color="white">Welcome to our newest project.  We begin in the name of Allah.  This site is developed to provide you with easy and free access to the Quran in MP3 format seperated into individual verse (verse by verse breakdown).   You can use this to assist you in memorizing the Quran, or if you are developing a Quran site or software.  Also you might be able to think of more creative ways to use this - for example build a presentation on Youtube or to do a presentation in your school on Islam.<br>
If you want to download all the files for a certain reciter, the best and easiest way is to use a program like DownloadThemAll for Firefox, or WebReaper (which is a bit harder to use). StarDownloader Free is another one, Or GetRight. Please make sure you set it to maximum 2 connections at once otherwise you may put too much strain on our server and cause others difficulties in accessing the files. We have a limit of less than 4 connections per person.<br>
